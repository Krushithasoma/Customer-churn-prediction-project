# Customer-churn-prediction-project
In this project, we have walked through a complete end-to-end machine learning project using the Telco customer 
Churn dataset. We started by cleaning the data and analyzing it with visualization. Then, to be able to build a 
machine learning model, we transformed the categorical data into numeric variables (feature engineering). After 
transforming the data, we tried 6 different machine learning algorithms using default parameters. 
The Decision tree, Random Forest and Gradient-boosted tree are the more efficient classifiers. However, the best 
model created according to the cross validation process seems to be the Decision tree. Indeed, the different metrics 
obtained by using this classifier are higher as well as very close to each other comparing to those of the other 
classifiers.
Thus, we can conclude that the big data analytics with machine learning techniques have proven to be accurate 
and effective to predict customer churn in nearby future
